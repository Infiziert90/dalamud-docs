# Migrating to Dalamud.NET.Sdk

Prior to the existance of an the Dalamud SDK, you would typically include the
`DalamudPackager` library with your project. The `packages.lock.json` file may
have a reference to `DalamudPackager`, and the NuGet Package Manager (if using
Visual Studio) will also have a DalamudPackager listed. This method is currently
deprecated and set to be removed as an option soon.

## Migration Steps

Migration is easy and the number of steps you must take depend on how old your
plugin is. Follow the steps below for each method as required.

### DalamudPackager Reference

1. Remove the DalamudPackager reference from your project.
2. Open your `.csproj` file (Right-click -> `Edit Project File` if Visual
   Studio)
3. Find the line `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">` in this file.
4. Replace it with: `<Project Sdk="Dalamud.NET.Sdk/12.0.2">` or the
   [current SDK version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dalamud.NET.Sdk) on
   nuget.
5. Locate the defined references for the various dalamud libraries and remove
   them as they're already included in the SDK (unless you are specifically
   overriding one or more for your own use cases). They will usually look like
   this in your `.csproj`:

```xml
    <Reference Include="Newtonsoft.Json">
      <HintPath>$(DalamudLibPath)Newtonsoft.Json.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="Dalamud">
      <HintPath>$(DalamudLibPath)Dalamud.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="ImGui.NET">
      <HintPath>$(DalamudLibPath)ImGui.NET.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="Lumina">
      <HintPath>$(DalamudLibPath)Lumina.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="Lumina.Excel">
      <HintPath>$(DalamudLibPath)Lumina.Excel.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="FFXIVClientStructs">
      <HintPath>$(DalamudLibPath)FFXIVClientStructs.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
```

6. Find and remove references to the addon hooks folder, as this is included in
   the SDK:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <DalamudLibPath>$(appdata)\XIVLauncher\addon\Hooks\dev\</DalamudLibPath>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

7. Optionally, you can remove most other fields under the `<PropertyGroup>`
   block, as everything is included in the SDK except `<Version>`, which is
   required. Fields specified here will override the Dalamud SDK.

You're done! Save the project and it should build successfully. Some stubborn
IDEs may need a restart first.

### Targets File Reference

The `.targets` method of building is also deprecated. Migrate by:

1. Removing your `Dalamud.Plugin.Bootstrap.targets` file.
2. Open your `.csproj` (Right-click -> Edit Project File in Visual Studio) and
   locate the following and delete it:

```xml
<Import Project="Dalamud.Plugin.Bootstrap.targets"/>
```

3. If you haven't already, Find the line `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">` in
   this file and replace it with: `<Project Sdk="Dalamud.NET.Sdk/12.0.2">` or
   the [current SDK version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dalamud.NET.Sdk).

You're done!
